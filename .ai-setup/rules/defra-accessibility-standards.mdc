# DEFRA Accessibility Standards

## ‚ôø WCAG 2.1 COMPLIANCE

### Compliance Requirements
- ALWAYS meet WCAG 2.1 Level A (minimum)
- ALWAYS meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA (required)
- STRIVE for Level AAA where possible
- ALWAYS test with real users
- ALWAYS document accessibility features
- NEVER compromise on accessibility

### Four Principles of Accessibility
1. **Perceivable**: Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
2. **Operable**: Interface components must be operable
3. **Understandable**: Information and UI operation must be understandable
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough for various assistive technologies

## üé® VISUAL DESIGN

### Color and Contrast
- ALWAYS maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios:
  - Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum
  - Large text: 3:1 minimum
  - UI components: 3:1 minimum
- NEVER rely on color alone to convey information
- ALWAYS provide additional visual cues
- ALWAYS test with color blindness simulators
- ALWAYS support high contrast modes

### Typography
- ALWAYS use readable fonts
- MINIMUM font size: 14px (desktop), 16px (mobile)
- ALWAYS allow text resizing up to 200%
- ALWAYS maintain readable line spacing (1.5x)
- ALWAYS limit line length (80 characters max)
- NEVER use justified text alignment

## ‚å®Ô∏è KEYBOARD NAVIGATION

### Keyboard Support
- ALWAYS ensure full keyboard accessibility
- ALWAYS provide visible focus indicators
- ALWAYS implement logical tab order
- ALWAYS support keyboard shortcuts
- NEVER create keyboard traps
- ALWAYS test without a mouse

### Focus Management
- ALWAYS show clear focus indicators
- ALWAYS manage focus programmatically when needed
- ALWAYS return focus after modal closes
- ALWAYS skip to main content link
- NEVER remove focus outlines without replacement
- ALWAYS test tab order thoroughly

## üñºÔ∏è IMAGES & MEDIA

### Alternative Text
- ALWAYS provide alt text for informative images
- ALWAYS use empty alt="" for decorative images
- ALWAYS describe image purpose, not appearance
- ALWAYS include text in images as alt text
- NEVER use "image of" or "picture of"
- ALWAYS make complex images accessible

### Multimedia Content
- ALWAYS provide captions for videos
- ALWAYS include audio descriptions
- ALWAYS offer transcripts
- ALWAYS provide controls for auto-playing content
- NEVER auto-play with sound
- ALWAYS allow pause/stop/hide for moving content

## üìã FORMS & INPUTS

### Form Accessibility
- ALWAYS associate labels with inputs
- ALWAYS group related fields
- ALWAYS provide clear instructions
- ALWAYS indicate required fields
- ALWAYS show inline error messages
- NEVER rely on placeholder text alone

### Error Handling
- ALWAYS identify errors clearly
- ALWAYS describe how to fix errors
- ALWAYS preserve user input
- ALWAYS announce errors to screen readers
- NEVER use color alone for errors
- ALWAYS validate accessibly

## üîä SCREEN READER SUPPORT

### ARIA Implementation
- ALWAYS use semantic HTML first
- ONLY use ARIA when necessary
- ALWAYS follow ARIA authoring practices
- ALWAYS test with screen readers
- NEVER change native semantics unnecessarily
- ALWAYS ensure ARIA labels are meaningful

### Screen Reader Testing
Test with:
- NVDA (Windows)
- JAWS (Windows)
- VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- TalkBack (Android)
- Always announce important changes
- Never create invisible content barriers

## üì± RESPONSIVE ACCESSIBILITY

### Mobile Accessibility
- ALWAYS ensure touch targets are 44x44px minimum
- ALWAYS provide adequate spacing between targets
- ALWAYS support both orientations
- ALWAYS test with mobile screen readers
- NEVER disable zoom
- ALWAYS support gesture alternatives

### Responsive Design
- ALWAYS maintain accessibility across breakpoints
- ALWAYS test at different zoom levels
- ALWAYS ensure content reflows properly
- ALWAYS maintain functionality at all sizes
- NEVER hide essential content
- ALWAYS provide mobile-friendly alternatives

## üß™ ACCESSIBILITY TESTING

### Testing Methods
- **Automated Testing**: Use tools like axe, WAVE, Pa11y
- **Manual Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **User Testing**: Include users with disabilities
- **Code Review**: Check for accessibility issues
- **Browser Testing**: Test across different browsers
- **Device Testing**: Test on various devices

### Testing Checklist
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation works
- ‚úÖ Screen reader compatible
- ‚úÖ Color contrast passes
- ‚úÖ Focus indicators visible
- ‚úÖ Forms are accessible
- ‚úÖ Images have alt text
- ‚úÖ Videos have captions
- ‚úÖ Content is understandable

## üìÑ CONTENT ACCESSIBILITY

### Writing for Accessibility
- ALWAYS use clear, simple language
- ALWAYS use descriptive headings
- ALWAYS structure content logically
- ALWAYS define abbreviations
- ALWAYS provide context for links
- NEVER use directional language alone

### Document Structure
- ALWAYS use proper heading hierarchy
- ALWAYS use lists for grouped items
- ALWAYS use tables for tabular data only
- ALWAYS provide table headers
- ALWAYS use landmarks appropriately
- NEVER skip heading levels

## üéØ SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

- ALWAYS show current location
- ALWAYS use consistent navigation
- ALWAYS provide breadcrumbs
- ALWAYS include search functionality
- NEVER change navigation unexpectedly

### Interactive Elements
- ALWAYS make buttons look clickable
- ALWAYS provide hover and focus states
- ALWAYS ensure adequate click areas
- ALWAYS provide loading indicators
- ALWAYS announce state changes
- NEVER use hover-only interactions

## üìä COMPLIANCE REPORTING

### Accessibility Statement
